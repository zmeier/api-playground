# api-playground
A web application used to experiment with various APIs like google maps, bing news, etc. 

A working copy of this is hosted on <a href="https://api-playground.herokuapp.com/">Heroku</a>. The weather API does not have an SSL endpoint so it is blocked by the browser. Don't put in a weather API key to see the news, maps, and foursquare data load.
